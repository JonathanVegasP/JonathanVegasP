### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a passionate software developer with over **6 years of experience**, specializing in **mobile development**.

I enjoy building performant and scalable solutions, and I’m especially focused on **clean architecture**, **native integration (FFI & platform channels)**, **code generation**, and **developer experience**.

I'm currently creating tools and libraries to push the limits of Flutter, from memory-optimized native interop to declarative route builders and serialization frameworks.

### 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Mobile**: Flutter, Dart, React Native, Kotlin (Android), Swift (iOS)
- **Backend**: Spring Boot (Java), .NET Core, Node.js
- **Frontend**: React, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, TailwindCSS
- **DevOps**: Docker, GitHub Actions
- **Cloud / Infra**: Firebase, AWS, Supabase
- **Other**: FFI, Codegen, SOLID Principles, Clean Architecture, Unit Testing

### 🚀 Featured Projects

- 🔧 `result_channel`: Native communication in Dart using pointers and deserialization — blazing fast and memory-safe.
- 🧭 `go_router_generator`: A `build_runner`-based automatic route tree generator for Flutter apps with type safety.

---

### 🧠 Currently Exploring

- Advanced FFI between Dart ↔ Rust / C++ / Swift / Kotlin
- Custom code generation using `build_runner` in Dart
- Low-level memory manipulation and performance tuning
- Scalable software architecture (SOLID, Clean Architecture)
